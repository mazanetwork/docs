# MAZA Network IPFS 
IPFS provide high availablty and wider distribution of data nodes can rely on 

While pushes and distribution of hashes is currently manual, the ipfs hash give assurance that the data that nodes acquire
was created by an authentic node. 

Data is currently pushed to ipfs from several nodes, so it's not seamless - in the future, a single IPNS hash will be 
all that's needed to find the correct data. 

This document presumes use of ```docker-compose.yml``` files included when you cloned the mazanode repo
